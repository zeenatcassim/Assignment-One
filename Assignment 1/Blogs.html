      Weekly blogs are the posts in which I wrote about the work I done weekly
      while going through the lectures, readings and other resources. Basically
      these are reflections based on the weekly work I had to do and progress of
      this website. Click on one of the below weekly blogs to read them:

      I installed GitHub last year for a project and have used it a few times to
      share projects thus I am a bit familiar on how to use some features.</p> 
      My goal for this course is to make easy to read and understandable websites.
      Some websites just have an overwhelming amount of information on it,
      displayed through complicated formats or structures. Which makes it hard
      to read and understand how the website functions and where to find what
      you are looking for. Most websites organize information into many
      different categories and as such, they have a table of contents to display
      this information. </p> 
      However, for a first-time user to always refer to the
      homepage to find the table of contents to then click on a specific topic
      they were looking for, is tedious. To combat this problem, I have noticed
      that websites display the table of contents pop up on all pages. This does
      make the user experience or flow smoother. I also have realized that when
      surfing the internet or looking through websites, users have the
      expectation that the next page of information, related to the one they are
      reading, will show up next for them to access.</p> I think it is quite
      interesting how the human brain stores information. In the reading, As We
      May Think, Bush states that humans think through pathways. They have one
      thought that leads to another, and this is how they remember information
      stored in their minds. Whereas machines have to browse through the
      information stored in them to bring up a topic. The reading then touches
      on the idea of selection by association. This stands out to me because
      nowadays when users use search engines, they can filter their ideas by
      selecting and deselecting topics. Or even just browse through ideas to
      find something that interests them. This in a way accommodates for the way
      the human brain thinks. Because then, the user clicks on the topic that
      interests them which will then lead them to having another thought and
      they may or may not, find something on the website that corresponds to
      that next thought.

        I have prior experience with html. I am familiar with the simple methods of coding html, such as 
        headings, titles and paragraphs. However, during this past weeks, the work has come off as overwhelming at 
        times but I am trying to take my time to understand the code and actually write it out so that I can understand it better. 
        I have read both the readings and from both of them, I have realised that coding websites 
        is not only about displaying information.</p> <p> Websites need to be functional, accessible and 
          easy on the eyes. Performance is hugely important too but this is also hugely linked to the functionality 
          of the website. The website can only perform well if it functions well. 
        Hierarchy is important, we need to distribute information in such a way that makes it easy for readers to
         read and understand. However, the way it looks is very important. Websites need to have the right background
          colours, font sizes, font types and decorative elements. It should not look overly pretty but it should not look ugly.
           It must look good enough for readers willing to stay and read its contents.</p> <p>
        In my opinion, these two factors work together. When a site looks good, readers stay and browse through it 
        but readers also need to, unconsciously or consciously, be aware of the information hierarchy. By having 
        the main heading appear larger than the section headings, makes the reader aware that these section 
        headings are just smaller topics of the main heading. Thus, why it is important to separate information 
        into their own containers. It leans more into the information hierarchy.
        Websites also need to work well in order to be successful. The links, the buttons 
        and the functionality need to respond to the reader’s action. If none of them work, 
        the reader will immediately log off the website because they are not getting what they
         came for. The functionality part of a website works because of the html code. 
      In conclusion, the designer needs to place information into containers and then display
       these in a hierarchy while also making their code work with the aim that the functionality
        of their code will make the website perform well.

 <p >The troubles I had with my website was the code part. 
  I forgot I had to add the normalize CSS code page to my folder and then have links for the 
  CSS scripts to the index HTML page. After, I added this scripts and links. I was able to 
  start developing my website. I can add borders, colour and boxes to my webpage by using classes but
   I am trying to figure out how to use CSS to code more complex decorative elements with html 
   functionality such as having images next to each other that are actually links to read other pages. </p>

  The concept of convention from the reading ties into UI and UX. In the lecture video, it can be surmised that the door had a poor design
   because users did not like how it worked. That specific door handle has the convention of pulling it to open the door. In this case, 
   this convention is completely changed because this door handle requires users to push it to open the door. Since the convention is
    different, users are unfamiliar with it and as a result, don’t like it.
Conventions are practices that are widely accepted and used in daily life. In the reading, it is stated that when a new practice is 
started, it shocks the audience and its medium. If others adopt this practice, then it becomes convention (Mailloux 1983: 399). In the 
case of the door handle, more than shock. Users despise the door handle and due to this, it can’t become a convention.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this idea applied to websites and their Ui/Ux. It is safe to assume that new practices can be started with them but as long as the 
  reader doesn’t hate it. Do not take existing conventions and change their function. However, websites need to maintain their standard 
  conventions of Ui and Ux because readers are used to certain design structures of websites.
You can’t code a paragraph to look like a heading, the paragraph’s convention is that its text is smaller than the heading to show that 
it’s giving more insight to it. If you change this convention, it doesn’t make sense and as a result, readers are going to despise it. If 
you do want to start a new convention, don’t change its function, rather expand more on it. For example, you can change the paragraph’s 
font, text color, background color or have the reader click on the heading to read the paragraph. In this case, the function doesn’t
 change, and readers can still understand it.
  I think it's good that we can access lectures that offer us different perspectives on the content. 
  Watching them really helps deepen my understanding of the work. It broadens your perspective and lets you looks at
   concepts or problems from different viewpoints and this really helps when it comes to problem solving.

        I looked at a previous wireframe for my website I drew out earlier and realized that it doesn’t work or function great like
         how I initially thought it would. The ui is simple on my wireframe but the website doesn’t function properly nor smoothly. 
         It is hard to get to the next section of information because I intended to have all information sections in their own webpage
          and I realized that the reader or user will have a problem going to one section and then back to the homepage to find the next 
          section of information.
I could solve this problem by having the user click a link to the next or previous section. A lot of websites do this but, in this case, 
it doesn’t make sense to make one individual webpage for each dev blog on the website. I think a better design decision would be to group 
two or three together in one webpage. I am going to test it out and see if it works.

        Based on the readings and lectures, the revisions I need to do for my website are adding in semiotics and functionality
         such as a navigation panel on the top of the website and links to get to the top and bottom of the webpage. I also need to 
         center most of the user interface to the center of the screen, make the design clear and simple and lastly minimize the 
         number of steps to get to the next webpage. Basically, I want the process of getting to the next section to be easy to 
         perform and fast while its being performed.
        Interactivity and UI are linked to each other. If interactivity is about having a response to an action being performed 
        than UI, is the element that helps inform the user that this a

        User Experience can be said to be the experience of interacting with an item or system. In this case, it is the 
        experience of interacting with a website. The reading explores these ideas of how design choices, like color and shapes and 
        \also portrayal of the hierarchy of information affects the user. A simple design choice of using a font can comfort the 
        human eye when reading it or hurt it. Having a paragraph centered to the middle or edge affects how a user is able to read it? 
        This just shows that design choices are not only there to attract the user but to ease and convince the user to be comfortable 
        while reading the website.

    <p class="week1for5and6-par-blog">I did not get much work done in these two weeks because I was feeling sick. However, I did manage to do
       some planning for my website and some of its elements; such as how the hierarchy of information is going to look. Though, I only 
       managed to plan one and it works as follows: Main title, followed by a paragraph of information. This paragraph will have a 
       semi-transparent colourful background because then the viewer will automatically think that all the paragraphs with a background 
       are small containers of information for the main heading of the webpage. I plan to use this idea for the weekly blogs. </p>

      Continuing my website development, I was faced with the problem of how to make links to get to
       other webpages and subsections. To combat this problem, I used anchor tags and made them look like buttons so that viewers 
       can see that they are interactable and when they click on them, it will take them to the required destination. 
      Then I decided to have another anchor tag to scroll up that lets the viewer go to the top of the webpage so that they don’t have 
      to scroll to wherever they want to go. I used this same principle to make a navigation bar but I am not sure whether it should stay
       in a fixed position like the scroll up anchor tag. </p>
         This feeds into my IxD process of information structure, content mapping and user flow. Since I decided to have all content in the
       middle of the webpage, the user flow will be directed in one direction and that is downwards. This will be convenient for the viewer
        because they will only have to look downwards to go to the next content of information. However, the user flow will also go in the 
        right direction but this is only to click on the scroll up function or to pick an anchor tag that will take them to the subsection 
        they want to read. 
      For the information structure, as stated above, all content will be situated towards the middle. Thereafter, I designed two type of
       information hierarchies and these are as follows: 1. Title of webpage, 2. Short paragraph and 3. Functions to go to required subsection
        of webpage. The other is as follows: 1. Title of subsection of webpage, 2. Paragraph with information and 2 will have a light colourful
         background. </p>
    
      The reading really touches on the nuances of UX. At first. UX is only seen as design but when you really try to understand it and 
      use it, UX becomes a topic of how effective your design is and last but not least, does it look attractive or not. But if a design 
      is effective does that mean that it has to be attractive? There is more to UX than just art and design but do these two factors 
      mostly overshadow the other factors that contribute to an effective user experience?
