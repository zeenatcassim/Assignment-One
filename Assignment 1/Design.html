    <h4 id="section1" class="title1-design">Original Wireframes</h4>
    <p class="par1-design">These are digital images showing what my previous wireframes looked like but I
      scrapped these because they are too simple and not very user friendly: 

     <img src="wireframe 1.png" alt="1"width= "300" height="400" class="wire1">
      <img src="wireframe 2.png" alt="2" width="500" height="400" class="wire1">
        
    </p>

    <h4 id="section2" class="title2-design">Style Guide</h4>
    <article class="par1-design">
      <h4 class="middle-centered">Goal and aesthetic as a single statement:</h4>
      <p>
        My goal and aesthetic for this website is to have all content situated
        towards the middle so that viewers don’t feel overwhelmed with different
        content placements and use cold colours to evoke a calm and relaxed
        atmosphere.
      </p>

      <h4 class="middle-centered">Visual design elements selected:</h4>
      <h5 class="middle-centered2">Fonts</h5>
      <p>
        I wanted the website’s font to be easy and legible to read but also look
        a bit attractive, that’s why I used sans serif because this font is very
        easy on the eyes, it doesn’t strain the viewer’s eyes when reading.
      </p>

      <h5 class="middle-centered2">Colours</h5>
      <p>
        I used cold colours between the shades blue and purple because these
        colours give off a very relaxed and calm atmosphere and it will be easy
        on the viewer’s eyes when reading the website’s content, I used light
        blue and purples as backgrounds for the paragraphs by the weekly blogs,
        design section, essay and portfolio but then reduced the transparency so
        that the words stand out more, the paragraphs seem separated from the
        foreground and this also lets the information hierarchy, that the
        paragraphs with a light background are sub sections of the main title,
        more visible to the viewer.
      </p>

      <h5 class="middle-centered2">Composition</h5>
      <p>
        I made all content situated towards middle of webpage because this makes
        hierarchy of information easier to understand and follow for viewer.
        Along with this, the hierarchy of information is symmetrically balanced
        so that all content stays in the middle and the user flow is directed in
        one direction. Also, viewers don’t end up feeling like elements are at
        odd places of webpage or that there is missing information at some sub
        sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        All content is nested; main titles are the parents and the paragraph
        below is the child. This is how the content is presented and repeated
        because most websites follow this convention and it works very well, I
        didn’t want to break this understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything is aligned to create harmony. As stated above, the user flow
        is directed in one direction and users don’t end up being confused and
        can predict or expect what information hierarchy will appear next. If
        content isn’t aligned, viewers will feel confused and immediately think
        that this is a bad website because then content won’t be presented
        properly and viewers won’t be able to learn information from the
        content.
      </p>

      <h5 class="middle-centered2">Interface elements</h5>
      <p>
        All interactable elements in the website are anchor tags that have round
        borders around them to look user friendly and interactable. The border
        lines aren’t thick to give it a smooth look and they have light
        background colours to make the text stand out. When viewers hover their
        cursor over it, the background changes to black and text to white to
        convince them even more that this is interactable and will take them to
        another webpage or subsection on that same webpage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The navigation bar is situated at top right, it has rounded edges to,
        again, look user-friendly and that it is interactable. These are also
        anchor tags and thus, when the viewer hovers above them, it will change
        colour to indicate that this is interactable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last interface element is a scroll up button that I have placed at
        the bottom right corner of the webpage. Its position is fixed so that
        wherever the viewer scrolls to, they will see this element and click on
        it if they want to go back to the top of the page.
      </p>

      <h4 class="middle-centered">Final design sketches</h4>
      <p>
        Show image of title, paragraph beneath and colour underneath paragraph’s
        writing to establish a hierarchy ++ webpage’s first to see, that
        hierarchy! Image of colours used for website to denote how calm and
        relaxing they look.
